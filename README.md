# Final Project: Neighborhood Map

This project consists of a map of my neighborhood, in Gettysburg, PA. It has several points of interest, which are all my favorite places to eat and drink in town. Each pinpoint on the map has a pop up window of additional information, and the marker animates upon clicking. There is a search functionality that filters the list of locations. This app is responsive and is built using Knockout and separation of concerns.
